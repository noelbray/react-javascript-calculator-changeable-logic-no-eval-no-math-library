# React Javascript Calculator With Changeable Logic

This is 2nd code modification of the Javascript Calculator code that I originally wrote on Codepen to complete the freeCodeCamp Javascript code challenge. This calculator calculates well and works the way I want it to, but since it was passing all but one of the freeCodeCamp "test suite" I had to modify the code again to get it to pass the 13th test. You can see the code for that calculator as well as my original code on Codepen.

*The code is raw, unrefactored.* Since this was a code challenge I was trying to complete, I didn't delete the commented out code because I was more concerned with learning, experimenting, and completing the challenge than commented out code affecting the code's appearance. 

I also left in the commented out code so that I can:
* keep from trying the same code that didn't work again
* retry it, reuse it
* to experiment with
* generate new ideas from

**About**

This *React Javascript Calculator*:
- allows the user to change from "Immediate Execution Logic" to "Formula/Expression Logic" and vice versa at anytime.
- does not use eval().
- does not us a math library.

**Instructions:** 

- click the "Change Calculator Logic" button to change the logic from "Immediate Execution Logic" to Formula/Expression Logic" and vice versa at your leisure. 
- If "Backspace" is pressed with an equal sign present, it will delete everything from the equal sign forward.

**Note:** 

- Feel free to play around with this calculator to find out what else it can and can't do. 


**Side Note:** 

If you have any suggestions on how to improve my code; or how I can or what I can do to become a better web developer, feel free to send me a message.
